 * never changes once assigned. Ids are drawn from a counter shared by all
 * products, so every product created in a run gets a distinct id.</p>
 *
 * <p>The product owns its <em>waitlist</em>: when an order asks for more units
 * than are in stock, the shortfall is recorded here as a {@link WaitlistItem},
 * and a later shipment fills those entries in the order the clients joined.</p>
